# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that saves events in local storage in the browser. Events can be entered into hour time blocks throughout the work day, and saved using the save button.

## Modifications

This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. HTML elements were inserted dynamically using JavaScript and saving capabilities were implemented with jQuery. Once an event is saved wit the save button, it is stored in local storage. This keeps the even on the calendar after the screen is refreshed.

## Credits

Tutor Megan Meyers assisted with syntax in the script.js file.
